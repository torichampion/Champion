### Origins and Botanical History
Among the nearly two hundred species of jasmine, three varieties feature prominently in the sensory and religious histories of many cultures: common jasmine, or poet’s jasmine (*Jasminum officinale*), Spanish jasmine (*Jasminum grandiflorum*), and Madurai jasmine, or Arabian jasmine (*Jasminum sambac*). People first began using jasmine in the plant’s native range of [Central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia) and [South Asia](Q771405). In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, its popularity spread from China, Persia, and India to Europe, although the method and date of its arrival in Europe “remains shrouded in mystery.”[^1] During its two-thousand-year history of cultivation in private gardens and harvest for scented products, jasmine has developed the power to conjure spaces and atmospheres of pleasure.[^2] The genus name *Jasminum* originates from *yāsamin*, a Persian word for a perfume made from jasmine flowers.[^3] Its flowers also embody significant sensory and symbolic influence in the religious practices and iconography of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity. In the East and West, jasmine in all varieties has been used to evoke the sensual and the sacred.

Jasmine is a member of the Oleaceae family, to which lilac, ash, and olive also belong. There is great diversity across its many varieties. Jasmine flowers can be white, yellow, and pink. The plants are native to temperate habitats and can be erect, spreading, or climbing, deciduous or evergreen. *J. officinale* is a climbing shrub that can grow up to eight meters, with flowers that blossom in late spring and early summer and small black berries that develop at the end of the season.[^4]

*J. officinale* and *J. grandiflorum* are most often cultivated for their fragrance and have become a major ingredient in mass-produced perfumes.[^5] People have long used these species to make perfumes—albeit at smaller scales—in *J. officinale*’s native region extending from Central Asia to South China and  *J. grandiflorum*’s range throughout South Asia, the Arabian Peninsula, East Africa, and South China.[^6]  *Jasminum sambac* is native to South Asia and has been a significant motif in Buddhist and Hindu traditions for centuries.[^7]

Jasmine has come to embody many meanings as diverse cultures have harnessed its powerful sensory qualities for personal adornment and religious practice. This plant narrative traces how the meanings that people have ascribed to jasmine have changed over time and across cultures.

### Jasmine as a Religious Motif
Religious worship is one of the most prominent contexts in which people have attached meanings to jasmine. Outside Hindu temples, merchants sell garlands strung with sweet-smelling flowers such as jasmine, marigold, roses, and spider lilies. The colorful and fragrant garlands are popular offerings in *puja*, a worship ritual demonstrating devotion to deities. During a *puja*, Hindu worshipers express their reverence by offering ritual objects, including flowers, which are “auspicious for the *puja* and the gods.”[^8] The flowers must be beautiful and emanate a sweet fragrance, as they contribute to the curation of a pleasing sensory atmosphere for both the devotees and deities. In his discussion with researcher Stine Bruland, a devotee at the Muthumari Amman Temple in La Chapelle, France, explains the sensual importance of flowers in Hindu prayer: 
> “Flowers are special in our religion (...) Decoration makes your mind a little happy, if you go out and see a beautiful lady or man, in good clothes, you are also happy. Your mind will be a little happy, attracted to that. The same thing attracts the people; it will encourage people to pray.”[^9]
Using vibrant and fragrant flowers such as jasmine as ritual items in *puja* encourages devotees to be more present in the act of praying, allowing them to form a deeper tangible connection to their gods.

The flowers also symbolize specific Hindu deities. White jasmine represents Lord Krishna, a very popular god who is hero worshipped as the eighth incarnation of the supreme Hindu deity Lord Vishnu.[^10] Lord Krishna’s teeth are often described as “glistening jasmine flowers” in liturgy.[^11] As jasmine is commonly associated with sensuality, it is unsurprising that blooming jasmine flowers turn Krishna’s “thoughts toward enjoying love.”[^12] The illustration from the *Gita Govinda*, a work by the poet Jayadeva that describes the relationship between Krishna and his consort, the goddess Radha, features jasmine. Its white flowers hang in garlands above the lovers and bloom in the surrounding vegetation of the bower.[^13]

The sacred text of the *Rāmāyaṇa* also features jasmine as a symbol of purity and beauty. The *Rāmāyaṇa* recounts the life of Rāma, a human incarnation of Lord Vishnu who defeats the demon Rāvaṇa. The below passage from the Sundarakāṇḍa, the fifth book of the *Rāmāyaṇa*, uses the motif of jasmine to help establish the youthful beauty of Rāma’s wife, Sītā. Similes liken her features to a waxing moon, a seed on the cusp of germination, and jasmine buds. Jasmine flowers release their strongest, most intoxicating scents when they bloom, so comparing Sītā’s teeth to jasmine buds— rather than an already-blossomed jasmine flower—characterizes her as a youthful, vigorous woman whose enticing beauty is yet to be fully realized.[^14]
> Then the auspicious and golden but slightly soiled garment of that bright-eyed woman—her limbs lovely and her teeth like the tips of jasmine buds—began to slip from its place. The fair-browed woman seemed to be restored to life by these and other auspicious signs she knew from before to be harbingers of good tidings, just as a seed—parched by wind and sun and nearly dead—revives with the rain. Her face—its lips like bimba fruit, its eyes, brows, bordering locks, and curling lashes lovely, and its teeth brilliant white—resembled the moon suddenly freed from the mouth of Rāhu, demon of the eclipse. Her sorrow dispelled, her lethargy gone, her fever cooled, and her spirit restored by joy, the noble lady’s face lent her the same radiance as the cool-rayed, waxing moon lends the night in rising.[^15]

Buddhism also regards jasmine as a flower of spiritual significance. In his book *The Culture of Flowers*, anthropologist Jack Goody includes the following description of a Buddhist ceremony in Sri Lanka:
